<p>A turtle confined in its shell, so tight,<br>Yet pushes ahead through storm and night.</p>



<p>Its armor may crack, but still, it tries,<br>Like hearts that heal as dawn will rise.</p>



<p>Through trials we fall, but stand again,<br>For strength is forged in loss and pain.</p>



<p>One step, one breath, one day at a time,<br>The mountain is climbed, the stars will align.</p>



<p>No need to fret, no need for fear,<br>For hope still whispers, &#8220;Persevere.&#8221;</p>

<p> A house with no roof, where peace rains,<br>Only silence rules, no cries, no chains.<br>A home of darkness, no flicker of light,<br>Only the soil knows its story, its plight.</p>



<p>For soil the house is, to soil it returns,<br>Where time stands still, and eternity burns.<br>A haven for insects, for rodents to reign,<br>Blowflies and flesh flies dance in the pain.</p>



<p>Beetles and ants, they gather in cheer,<br>For this is their joy, their home sincere.<br>The bones grow dry when love has flown,<br>All that remains is the echo of stone.</p>



<p>O house with no roof, a silent domain,<br>You linger in shadows, through sun and rain.<br>Here lies the truth, where stillness grows,<br>Where the earth reclaims all it knows.</p>

<p>It was a bright afternoon, and Tony sat in his home office, headphones on, eyes glued to the lines of code on his screen. He was engrossed in reviewing a website design, adjusting colors, tweaking fonts, and testing functionality. As a software engineer, Tony thrived in this world of logic and creativity. The concentration was intense, and the faint hum of his laptop accompanied the clicking of his keyboard.</p>



<p>Then, his phone buzzed. He glanced at it, frowning at the unknown number on the screen.</p>



<p>He debated whether to pick up. Unknown numbers often brought scam calls, awkward wrong numbers, or terse requests for surveys. Yet, curiosity got the better of him.</p>



<p>“Hello?” Tony said cautiously.</p>



<p>“Hi,” came the voice on the other end. It was a warm, friendly voice, though slightly uncertain. “Is this Tony?”</p>



<p>“Yes, this is Tony,” he replied. “Who’s calling?”</p>



<p>“My name’s Brightone,” the caller said. “I hope I’m not bothering you. I was trying to reach Tony—the one I spoke to earlier about a job opportunity.”</p>



<p>Tony raised an eyebrow. “I think you might have the wrong number. I’m not sure who you’re looking for, but I don’t recall any discussions about jobs.”</p>



<p>A pause followed, and Tony could almost feel the disappointment radiating through the phone.</p>



<p>“Oh,” Brightone said finally. “I must’ve dialed the wrong number. I was looking for the Tony who promised to help me find a job. I studied Biochemistry at the University of Nairobi and have been struggling to find something in the field.”</p>

<p>Tony’s interest was piqued. He leaned back in his chair, temporarily setting his work aside.</p>



<p>“Biochemistry,” he repeated, nodding to himself. “That’s a challenging but fascinating field. So you’ve been looking for work since you graduated?”</p>



<p>“Yes,” Brightone said, his tone softening as he spoke. “I’m really passionate about Biochemistry. It’s what I’ve always wanted to do, but opportunities are scarce, and I’ve been applying everywhere with no success.”</p>



<p>Tony listened, feeling a pang of empathy.</p>



<p>The world, so wide, so vast, so full,<br>Yet dreams are caught in life’s cruel pull.<br>A passion burning, bright, sincere,<br>Yet doors stay shut, hope turns to fear.</p>



<p>Life’s path, they say, is rarely straight,<br>Its twists and turns defined by fate.<br>And yet, we rise, we strive, we climb,<br>To catch the stars, to seize the time.</p>



<p>Tony broke the silence that followed the unspoken weight of Brightone’s words. “That must be really frustrating. Have you thought about exploring other fields while you wait for the right opportunity in Biochemistry?”</p>



<p>Brightone hesitated. “Well, yes, actually. I’ve always had some interest in ICT. I even started learning Python and R at one point. But…” His voice trailed off.</p>



<p>“But?” Tony prompted.</p>



<p>“I didn’t finish,” Brightone admitted with a self-deprecating laugh. “I started but never saw it through. Life got in the way, or maybe I just didn’t push myself enough.”</p>



<p>Tony smiled, though Brightone couldn’t see it. “That’s more common than you’d think. But you know, it’s never too late to pick it up again. Python is a great language, and if you’re looking for something manageable, you could try learning Flask. It’s a framework that’s easier to start with than Django, though it really depends on what you’re building.”</p>



<p>The best time to learn is yesterday,<br>They often say, but do not dismay.<br>For every moment, fresh and new,<br>Holds the power to see it through.</p>



<p>The hands of time may seem unkind,<br>But wisdom grows with every bind.<br>Begin today, with heart and mind,<br>And see what wonders you might find.</p>



<p>Brightone chuckled. “You sound like you’ve given this speech before.”</p>



<p>“Maybe,” Tony replied with a grin. “But seriously, you should give it another shot. Even if you go back to Biochemistry, having ICT skills could make you stand out. Employers love people who can bridge different fields. And Python? That’s useful almost anywhere.”</p>



<p>Brightone’s voice brightened. “You know, I think I will. Maybe it’s time to stop waiting for the right opportunity and start creating it.”</p>



<p>“That’s the spirit,” Tony said warmly. “Sometimes, the doors we’re waiting for don’t open because we’re meant to build our own.”</p>



<p>The world spins tales we cannot see,<br>A stranger’s voice, a destiny.<br>In moments chance, in calls unknown,<br>A seed of friendship may be sown.</p>



<p>For a moment, the two strangers were silent, connected by an unexpected sense of camaraderie.</p>



<p>Tony added, “You know, it’s funny how things happen. Sometimes, the wrong call can lead to the right connection. Life has a way of surprising us.”</p>



<p>The stars above may seem so far,<br>But guide us gently where we are.<br>Each stumble, twist, and winding bend,<br>Can lead us closer to a friend.</p>



<p>“You’re absolutely right,” Brightone said, his tone carrying newfound hope. “This call didn’t go as planned, but I think it was meant to happen. Thank you, Tony. You’ve given me a lot to think about.”</p>



<p>“Anytime, Brightone,” Tony replied. “And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions. We all need a little help sometimes.”</p>



<p>As the call ended, Tony returned to his work with a smile, the conversation lingering in his mind.</p>



<p>Sometimes, the world surprises us in the most unexpected ways. A wrong number, a stranger’s voice—these moments have the power to shape our days, to spark new ideas, to turn strangers into friends.</p>



<p>And as Brightone looked at his notebook that evening, ready to scribble down Python tutorials, he, too, smiled. Maybe, just maybe, the wrong call had been the right one all along.</p>

<p>In one of the bustling industrialized cities, there lived two engineering students named Teddy and Tensely. As classmates and close friends, the duo was inseparable. They studied together, shared meals, and often delved into their shared passion for engineering and technology. Among their many pursuits, information technology, coding, and even hacking intrigued them the most.</p>



<p>Tensely, in particular, was deeply obsessed with learning the art of hacking. While others focused solely on assignments and exams, Tensely immersed himself in understanding the vulnerabilities of systems. Teddy, on the other hand, was more pragmatic, a survival tactician who understood the city’s underbelly. Teddy&#8217;s street-smart ways complemented Tensely’s technical prowess, creating a dynamic partnership.</p>



<p>The two friends had an unbreakable bond, often likened to covalent bonds in chemistry—strong and enduring. They supported each other through thick and thin, including navigating tricky exams and dodging the watchful eyes of professors. Their teamwork was impeccable, each step meticulously planned and executed.</p>



<p>One evening, as the two were basking in the glow of the setting sun, Teddy turned to Tensely with a question that would change everything:<br>“Do you trust me?”<br>Tensely, with a thunderous certainty, responded, “Of course, I do.”</p>



<p>Teddy then shared an audacious idea—hacking an ATM to withdraw money undetected. At first, the plan seemed too bold, even for Tensely. But soon, his curiosity and hunger for adventure took over. The notion of pulling off such a heist was too thrilling to resist.</p>



<p>However, this wasn’t a scheme to be rushed. Teddy insisted on careful planning, knowing full well the consequences of being caught. The duo needed a stolen credit card to avoid leaving any traceable links to themselves. While Teddy worked on refining their strategy, Tensely took on the task of acquiring the crucial card.</p>



<p>One weekend, Tensely visited a neighbor’s house under the guise of casual conversation. While there, he stealthily swiped a credit card, fulfilling his part of the plan. Returning to campus, he eagerly presented the stolen card to Teddy, who praised his efforts but urged patience. They had pending coursework to complete before moving forward.</p>



<p>Three days later, the long-awaited moment arrived. The duo donned disguises to avoid being identified by CCTV cameras. Dressed in hoodies and masks, they scoped out the ATM and its surroundings, noting the positions of security guards. With all preparations in place, Tensely approached the machine, card in hand.</p>



<p>Teddy, stationed a safe distance away, monitored the situation. The plan was for Tensely to follow the sequence of commands Teddy had painstakingly programmed. If all went smoothly, the ATM would release the cash, and they would make a swift getaway.</p>



<p>As Tensely inserted the card and began the hack, adrenaline coursed through his veins. The machine whirred to life, and money started spewing out. Tensely quickly stuffed the bills into the bag he had brought. But just as things seemed to be going perfectly, disaster struck.</p>



<p>The ATM emitted a loud alarm, a security measure Teddy hadn’t anticipated. Tensely froze momentarily before grabbing the last of the cash and bolting out. Teddy, hearing the alarm, signaled Tensely to run. The two sprinted into the night, hearts pounding as the sound of approaching sirens grew louder.</p>



<p>Their carefully crafted plan was unraveling. The stolen card had triggered a bank alert, and security cameras had captured enough footage to raise suspicion. Though their disguises hid their identities, the authorities were now on high alert.</p>



<p>The two friends managed to escape the immediate vicinity, but the weight of their actions began to sink in. The thrill of the heist was replaced by the chilling realization that they were now fugitives. What started as a daring escapade had turned into a nightmare.</p>



<p>In the days that followed, tensions grew between Teddy and Tensely. Teddy blamed Tensely for acting impulsively, while Tensely accused Teddy of underestimating the risks. Their once-unbreakable bond was now strained under the pressure of their failed heist.</p>



<p>Eventually, the law caught up with them. A combination of forensic evidence and witness testimonies led to their arrest. Standing before the judge, they faced the grim reality of their choices. Their dreams of a bright future in engineering had been eclipsed by a reckless decision born out of arrogance and greed.</p>
