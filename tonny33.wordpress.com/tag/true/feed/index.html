<p>In one of the bustling industrialized cities, there lived two engineering students named Teddy and Tensely. As classmates and close friends, the duo was inseparable. They studied together, shared meals, and often delved into their shared passion for engineering and technology. Among their many pursuits, information technology, coding, and even hacking intrigued them the most.</p>



<p>Tensely, in particular, was deeply obsessed with learning the art of hacking. While others focused solely on assignments and exams, Tensely immersed himself in understanding the vulnerabilities of systems. Teddy, on the other hand, was more pragmatic, a survival tactician who understood the city’s underbelly. Teddy&#8217;s street-smart ways complemented Tensely’s technical prowess, creating a dynamic partnership.</p>



<p>The two friends had an unbreakable bond, often likened to covalent bonds in chemistry—strong and enduring. They supported each other through thick and thin, including navigating tricky exams and dodging the watchful eyes of professors. Their teamwork was impeccable, each step meticulously planned and executed.</p>



<p>One evening, as the two were basking in the glow of the setting sun, Teddy turned to Tensely with a question that would change everything:<br>“Do you trust me?”<br>Tensely, with a thunderous certainty, responded, “Of course, I do.”</p>



<p>Teddy then shared an audacious idea—hacking an ATM to withdraw money undetected. At first, the plan seemed too bold, even for Tensely. But soon, his curiosity and hunger for adventure took over. The notion of pulling off such a heist was too thrilling to resist.</p>



<p>However, this wasn’t a scheme to be rushed. Teddy insisted on careful planning, knowing full well the consequences of being caught. The duo needed a stolen credit card to avoid leaving any traceable links to themselves. While Teddy worked on refining their strategy, Tensely took on the task of acquiring the crucial card.</p>



<p>One weekend, Tensely visited a neighbor’s house under the guise of casual conversation. While there, he stealthily swiped a credit card, fulfilling his part of the plan. Returning to campus, he eagerly presented the stolen card to Teddy, who praised his efforts but urged patience. They had pending coursework to complete before moving forward.</p>



<p>Three days later, the long-awaited moment arrived. The duo donned disguises to avoid being identified by CCTV cameras. Dressed in hoodies and masks, they scoped out the ATM and its surroundings, noting the positions of security guards. With all preparations in place, Tensely approached the machine, card in hand.</p>



<p>Teddy, stationed a safe distance away, monitored the situation. The plan was for Tensely to follow the sequence of commands Teddy had painstakingly programmed. If all went smoothly, the ATM would release the cash, and they would make a swift getaway.</p>



<p>As Tensely inserted the card and began the hack, adrenaline coursed through his veins. The machine whirred to life, and money started spewing out. Tensely quickly stuffed the bills into the bag he had brought. But just as things seemed to be going perfectly, disaster struck.</p>



<p>The ATM emitted a loud alarm, a security measure Teddy hadn’t anticipated. Tensely froze momentarily before grabbing the last of the cash and bolting out. Teddy, hearing the alarm, signaled Tensely to run. The two sprinted into the night, hearts pounding as the sound of approaching sirens grew louder.</p>



<p>Their carefully crafted plan was unraveling. The stolen card had triggered a bank alert, and security cameras had captured enough footage to raise suspicion. Though their disguises hid their identities, the authorities were now on high alert.</p>



<p>The two friends managed to escape the immediate vicinity, but the weight of their actions began to sink in. The thrill of the heist was replaced by the chilling realization that they were now fugitives. What started as a daring escapade had turned into a nightmare.</p>



<p>In the days that followed, tensions grew between Teddy and Tensely. Teddy blamed Tensely for acting impulsively, while Tensely accused Teddy of underestimating the risks. Their once-unbreakable bond was now strained under the pressure of their failed heist.</p>



<p>Eventually, the law caught up with them. A combination of forensic evidence and witness testimonies led to their arrest. Standing before the judge, they faced the grim reality of their choices. Their dreams of a bright future in engineering had been eclipsed by a reckless decision born out of arrogance and greed.</p>
