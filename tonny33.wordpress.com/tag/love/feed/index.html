					<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;ve fallen for you, it&#8217;s true—so true,Yet words slip away, lost in the blue—so blue. Your laughter lingers in my chest—my chest,A melody sweet, yet unexpressed—unexpressed. I watch you shine like morning&#8217;s light—soft light,Yet silence holds me through the night—cold night. If only the wind could tell my heart—my heart,How longing tears my soul apart—apart. [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p>Ooh, what a mystery, what a sight,<br>A whisper of wings in golden light.<br>From fragile eggs on tender leaves,<br>Life begins—soft as a dream it weaves.</p>



<p>Yes, a change, a wondrous thing,<br>A crawling form, yet set to wing.<br>The caterpillar, slow and small,<br>Yet holds within the promise of all.</p>



<p>Wrapped in stillness, tucked away,<br>A silent prayer, night meets day.<br>Cocooned in patience, time must flow,<br>Till life awakens, set to glow.</p>



<p>And then—ooh, behold the flight!<br>Colors bursting, pure delight.<br>The <strong>butterfly</strong>, a whispered grace,<br>A love of sky, a soft embrace.</p>



<p>What lessons in this dance so bright?<br>To change, to grow, to seek the light.<br>A symbol true, for man to see,<br>That life’s own hands bring destiny.</p>



<p>With wings of joy, the earth it sings,<br>The <strong>rain</strong> it calls, the <strong>pests</strong> it stills.<br>A balance held in fragile might,<br>A gift of love, a world in flight.</p>

<p>In a world full of friendships and dating scenes, relationships have become a complex market of choices and preferences. It&#8217;s always good and even perfect when your friend knows you&#8217;re &#8220;soko&#8221; — that you&#8217;re out there looking for someone. The soko is normally full of tomatoes, and it&#8217;s upon you to choose the tomato of your choice, perchance the one that best satisfies your needs.</p>



<p>But as it stands, there are so many intricacies when it comes to choosing. The ladies in the soko and the men in the same often have a well-structured list of their ideal partners. Ladies often prefer tall men with six packs, probably dark-skinned. On the other hand, many men love thick babes, brown-skinned ones, or even petite babes who drive them crazy. It&#8217;s a game, and as unfair as it might be, it&#8217;s often rigged against short or middle-sized men who tend to become the last resort. But that doesn’t mean all hope is lost.</p>



<p>Down trodden in the middle of ghosting.<br>From the babes I was taking stage with.<br>The earth sank low for me.<br>Never to get this place to rest on.<br>You can imagine with me,<br>Having someone you talk to every day.<br>And suddenly, she decides to ghost.<br>What a hell on earth.</p>



<p>You know instincts? I regretted not following mine with this specific lady. My instincts were utterly against her. But who was I? I decided to pursue her, against the warning bells ringing in my head, even though they were clear—this lady was bound to break my heart. One fine day, in the middle of my work coding, I got a WhatsApp text from my friend Gordon.</p>



<p>The text read: &#8220;I want to give you a lady.&#8221;</p>



<p>Before deciding whether to accept or decline, I thought to myself: <em>Bro, who told you I’m heartbroken? Who told you I need a new talking stage?</em> But after some deliberation, I thought, <em>Why not?</em> I asked for the number. WAIT. I didn’t even consider the possibility that this friend of mine could be giving me the number of his ex or someone problematic. He claimed they were childhood friends, but from my observation, they resembled each other a bit—which made me wonder if they might be cousins.</p>



<p>Still, the thought—<em>what if she’s the one</em>—pushed me to accept. It’s the same thought that made me pursue the lady who ghosted me, even when all the red flags were screaming.</p>



<p>Let nature teach you.<br>You are not in it alone.<br>It will provide for your grievances.<br>They will be all gone.<br>Nature has answers to all our quests.<br>Yes, yes, it does.</p>



<p>Nature teaches us to be better in relationships, engineering, and even in innovations yet to come.</p>



<p>This petite-looking lady, Tinah, had an admirable figure, and I trusted she might be the one. It was an interesting affair. I even asked her if she thought I was the one, and she confidently said yes. At first, Tinah seemed genuinely interested in me. But as the holy book says, <em>time and chance happen to them all.</em></p>



<p>In this new talking stage, I carried unhealed trauma. Several times, I tried to bring up the matter of my previous ghosting experience, but it all went in vain.</p>



<p>Better now or never.<br>Say whatever makes you uncomfortable.<br>Just as the saying goes,<br>The early bird catches the worm.<br>In all aspects of life,<br>Communication is always key.</p>



<p>I felt guilty for not telling her, but at the same time, I wondered if her interest in me was waning because she saw my picture. Maybe she wasn’t interested in dating a techie guy who looked the way I do. We never met in person to explore if we were compatible beyond the surface.</p>



<p>This is one of the reasons I hate online dating. I mean, like, you don’t know someone in person, yet you want to date them? Wait, are you normal? Online dating feels like ordering a package of goods without knowing how it tastes, its size, or its weight.</p>



<p>There are things worth studying carefully. Men should approach someone they’re interested in, and ladies should give clear signals to help guys pursue them. I consider someone involved in online dating to be weak in one way or another. Kwani, watu uko karibu na wao hakuna mtu? If not, explore other options. Online dating is full of scams and shenanigans.</p>



<p>Your assumptions and imaginations<br>Shape who you are.<br>Yes, they do.<br>They define you and even your future.</p>



<p>One evening, while busy preparing my supper, Mary—the lady who ghosted me—called out of the blue. My first thought was: <em>Yooh! Who told you I’m traumatized for you to call me and calm my spirits?</em></p>



<p>She’d ghosted me, and now today she decides to check in? That call brightened my evening, and consequential actions followed. We planned to meet and resolve everything amicably, to plan a way forward for the two of us. But, as fate would have it, we never met to resolve anything. It all seemed to die again.</p>



<p>Time and chance will one day happen to them all, I gaze.</p>



<p>Hearts may be broken.<br>You may be traumatized.<br>You may be left alone in the ditch.<br>You may see only dust.<br>But remember,<br>You always have yourself to dust off<br>And move on.<br>Trust your instincts.<br>Never forget,<br>Your assumptions and imaginations<br>Are there to shape your life.</p>

<p>It was a bright afternoon, and Tony sat in his home office, headphones on, eyes glued to the lines of code on his screen. He was engrossed in reviewing a website design, adjusting colors, tweaking fonts, and testing functionality. As a software engineer, Tony thrived in this world of logic and creativity. The concentration was intense, and the faint hum of his laptop accompanied the clicking of his keyboard.</p>



<p>Then, his phone buzzed. He glanced at it, frowning at the unknown number on the screen.</p>



<p>He debated whether to pick up. Unknown numbers often brought scam calls, awkward wrong numbers, or terse requests for surveys. Yet, curiosity got the better of him.</p>



<p>“Hello?” Tony said cautiously.</p>



<p>“Hi,” came the voice on the other end. It was a warm, friendly voice, though slightly uncertain. “Is this Tony?”</p>



<p>“Yes, this is Tony,” he replied. “Who’s calling?”</p>



<p>“My name’s Brightone,” the caller said. “I hope I’m not bothering you. I was trying to reach Tony—the one I spoke to earlier about a job opportunity.”</p>



<p>Tony raised an eyebrow. “I think you might have the wrong number. I’m not sure who you’re looking for, but I don’t recall any discussions about jobs.”</p>



<p>A pause followed, and Tony could almost feel the disappointment radiating through the phone.</p>



<p>“Oh,” Brightone said finally. “I must’ve dialed the wrong number. I was looking for the Tony who promised to help me find a job. I studied Biochemistry at the University of Nairobi and have been struggling to find something in the field.”</p>

<p>Tony’s interest was piqued. He leaned back in his chair, temporarily setting his work aside.</p>



<p>“Biochemistry,” he repeated, nodding to himself. “That’s a challenging but fascinating field. So you’ve been looking for work since you graduated?”</p>



<p>“Yes,” Brightone said, his tone softening as he spoke. “I’m really passionate about Biochemistry. It’s what I’ve always wanted to do, but opportunities are scarce, and I’ve been applying everywhere with no success.”</p>



<p>Tony listened, feeling a pang of empathy.</p>



<p>The world, so wide, so vast, so full,<br>Yet dreams are caught in life’s cruel pull.<br>A passion burning, bright, sincere,<br>Yet doors stay shut, hope turns to fear.</p>



<p>Life’s path, they say, is rarely straight,<br>Its twists and turns defined by fate.<br>And yet, we rise, we strive, we climb,<br>To catch the stars, to seize the time.</p>



<p>Tony broke the silence that followed the unspoken weight of Brightone’s words. “That must be really frustrating. Have you thought about exploring other fields while you wait for the right opportunity in Biochemistry?”</p>



<p>Brightone hesitated. “Well, yes, actually. I’ve always had some interest in ICT. I even started learning Python and R at one point. But…” His voice trailed off.</p>



<p>“But?” Tony prompted.</p>



<p>“I didn’t finish,” Brightone admitted with a self-deprecating laugh. “I started but never saw it through. Life got in the way, or maybe I just didn’t push myself enough.”</p>



<p>Tony smiled, though Brightone couldn’t see it. “That’s more common than you’d think. But you know, it’s never too late to pick it up again. Python is a great language, and if you’re looking for something manageable, you could try learning Flask. It’s a framework that’s easier to start with than Django, though it really depends on what you’re building.”</p>



<p>The best time to learn is yesterday,<br>They often say, but do not dismay.<br>For every moment, fresh and new,<br>Holds the power to see it through.</p>



<p>The hands of time may seem unkind,<br>But wisdom grows with every bind.<br>Begin today, with heart and mind,<br>And see what wonders you might find.</p>



<p>Brightone chuckled. “You sound like you’ve given this speech before.”</p>



<p>“Maybe,” Tony replied with a grin. “But seriously, you should give it another shot. Even if you go back to Biochemistry, having ICT skills could make you stand out. Employers love people who can bridge different fields. And Python? That’s useful almost anywhere.”</p>



<p>Brightone’s voice brightened. “You know, I think I will. Maybe it’s time to stop waiting for the right opportunity and start creating it.”</p>



<p>“That’s the spirit,” Tony said warmly. “Sometimes, the doors we’re waiting for don’t open because we’re meant to build our own.”</p>



<p>The world spins tales we cannot see,<br>A stranger’s voice, a destiny.<br>In moments chance, in calls unknown,<br>A seed of friendship may be sown.</p>



<p>For a moment, the two strangers were silent, connected by an unexpected sense of camaraderie.</p>



<p>Tony added, “You know, it’s funny how things happen. Sometimes, the wrong call can lead to the right connection. Life has a way of surprising us.”</p>



<p>The stars above may seem so far,<br>But guide us gently where we are.<br>Each stumble, twist, and winding bend,<br>Can lead us closer to a friend.</p>



<p>“You’re absolutely right,” Brightone said, his tone carrying newfound hope. “This call didn’t go as planned, but I think it was meant to happen. Thank you, Tony. You’ve given me a lot to think about.”</p>



<p>“Anytime, Brightone,” Tony replied. “And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions. We all need a little help sometimes.”</p>



<p>As the call ended, Tony returned to his work with a smile, the conversation lingering in his mind.</p>



<p>Sometimes, the world surprises us in the most unexpected ways. A wrong number, a stranger’s voice—these moments have the power to shape our days, to spark new ideas, to turn strangers into friends.</p>



<p>And as Brightone looked at his notebook that evening, ready to scribble down Python tutorials, he, too, smiled. Maybe, just maybe, the wrong call had been the right one all along.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Marriage and dating—timeless concepts that remain deeply intertwined with personal, societal, and cultural values—are as complicated as they are fascinating. In today’s fast-evolving world, these ideas continue to be challenged, redefined, and sometimes even rejected. This article seeks to explore the intricate layers of marriage and dating through the lens of unique personal experiences, cultural expectations, and modern approaches.</p>

</div></div>



<p>Dating and marriage have always been complex aspects of human relationships, influenced by culture, personal preferences, and societal norms. A fascinating example of this complexity is the story of a man who took a rather unconventional approach to express his interest in a woman. Instead of directly approaching Shiku, the lady he admired, he decided to talk to her mother first. This bold strategy, perhaps influenced by tradition or a desire to show respect, led to a sequence of events that tested his patience, resilience, and understanding of modern dating dynamics.</p>



<p>After making his intentions known to Shiku&#8217;s mother, he had to wait for two days to receive an answer. When he returned, he encountered Shiku, who bluntly rejected him. Insisting on hearing the verdict from her mother, he faced further complications. Her mother, seemingly overwhelmed by the numerous customers she dealt with daily, initially failed to recognize him. Matters escalated when a man in the house, assumed to be Shiku&#8217;s father, became confrontational upon learning of his intentions. The situation spiraled into a heated confrontation, with Shiku herself stepping in aggressively. Although the man escaped unharmed, the experience left him deeply traumatized, questioning the effectiveness of his approach.</p>



<p>Reflecting on this incident, one might consider the various factors at play. Was this a case of natural rejection, tribal bias, or miscommunication? His experience sheds light on the challenges of modern dating, where traditional and contemporary values often clash. While his approach was unconventional, it highlighted the evolving nature of relationships, where direct communication and mutual understanding are becoming increasingly crucial.</p>



<p>In today&#8217;s world, dating comes with its own set of expectations and complexities. Some advocate for the return of arranged marriages, arguing that they offered stability and alignment of values. However, this approach is not without its critics, particularly those who value personal choice and emotional connection. Another option is referrals, where trusted friends or family members introduce potential partners, offering a middle ground between arranged and self-initiated relationships. Ultimately, many prefer the freedom to choose their partners, although this freedom sometimes leads to repeated cycles of trial and error.</p>



<p>The role of men and women in relationships is also a topic of debate. While some argue for traditional roles, others emphasize equality and shared responsibility. The Bible, for instance, underscores the significance of men leading their families, though this interpretation varies among individuals. Modern relationships demand flexibility and mutual respect, with both parties contributing to their success.</p>



<p>For some, dating is likened to a supermarket experience—selecting and discarding partners at will. This perception, while criticized, reflects the transient nature of some modern relationships. Despite these challenges, the essence of dating and marriage remains rooted in effort, commitment, and shared values. As the Word affirms marriage as God-ordained, it emphasizes the importance of nurturing relationships with care and intention.</p>



<p>Ultimately, dating in the modern era requires adaptability and self-awareness. Whether through traditional methods, referrals, or contemporary approaches, individuals must navigate the complexities with patience and integrity. While the journey may not always be smooth, the lessons learned along the way contribute to personal growth and a deeper understanding of what it takes to build a meaningful relationship.</p>

<p>What is life without the new?<br>From dishes to clothes, to cars that woo,<br>We crave the fresh, the shiny, the bold,<br>Chasing treasures, stories untold.</p>



<p>Some swap partners like swapping shoes,<br>Seeking thrills, a fresh muse.<br>But what does “new” bring to the soul?<br>Does it truly mend? Does it make us whole?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Curiosity—oh, how it calls!<br>A siren song in life’s great halls.<br>From entrepreneurs with their clever spins,<br>To tech wizards crafting groundbreaking wins.</p>



<p>New ideas, new ways, a relentless chase,<br>Fueling the progress of the human race.<br>Yet, pause a moment, and let us see,<br>Is the &#8220;new&#8221; as golden as it seems to be?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>The mind, it’s wired for exploration,<br>Thriving on innovation and creation.<br>Yet every choice, a burden to bear,<br>33,000 decisions, filling the air.</p>



<p>What to eat, what to wear, what to say,<br>Countless moments shape our day.<br>New ideas, they double the stakes,<br>Making each choice a gamble we take.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>A world of dynamics, spinning fast,<br>From yesterday’s wonders to futures vast.<br>The subconscious wrestles, the conscious debates,<br>Which path to follow, what action awaits.</p>



<p>Yes, the “new” controls and propels,<br>But it burdens and excites as well.<br>So let us embrace it, wisely and true,<br>For life’s daring adventure lies in the &#8220;new.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p><br>The new—it thrills, it guides, it steers,<br>It sparks our joys, it fuels our fears.<br>But with each choice, a chance to grow,<br>A daring adventure, as Helen would know.</p>
