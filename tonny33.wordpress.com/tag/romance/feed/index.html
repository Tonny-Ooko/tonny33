					<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;ve fallen for you, it&#8217;s true—so true,Yet words slip away, lost in the blue—so blue. Your laughter lingers in my chest—my chest,A melody sweet, yet unexpressed—unexpressed. I watch you shine like morning&#8217;s light—soft light,Yet silence holds me through the night—cold night. If only the wind could tell my heart—my heart,How longing tears my soul apart—apart. [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p>In a world full of friendships and dating scenes, relationships have become a complex market of choices and preferences. It&#8217;s always good and even perfect when your friend knows you&#8217;re &#8220;soko&#8221; — that you&#8217;re out there looking for someone. The soko is normally full of tomatoes, and it&#8217;s upon you to choose the tomato of your choice, perchance the one that best satisfies your needs.</p>



<p>But as it stands, there are so many intricacies when it comes to choosing. The ladies in the soko and the men in the same often have a well-structured list of their ideal partners. Ladies often prefer tall men with six packs, probably dark-skinned. On the other hand, many men love thick babes, brown-skinned ones, or even petite babes who drive them crazy. It&#8217;s a game, and as unfair as it might be, it&#8217;s often rigged against short or middle-sized men who tend to become the last resort. But that doesn’t mean all hope is lost.</p>



<p>Down trodden in the middle of ghosting.<br>From the babes I was taking stage with.<br>The earth sank low for me.<br>Never to get this place to rest on.<br>You can imagine with me,<br>Having someone you talk to every day.<br>And suddenly, she decides to ghost.<br>What a hell on earth.</p>



<p>You know instincts? I regretted not following mine with this specific lady. My instincts were utterly against her. But who was I? I decided to pursue her, against the warning bells ringing in my head, even though they were clear—this lady was bound to break my heart. One fine day, in the middle of my work coding, I got a WhatsApp text from my friend Gordon.</p>



<p>The text read: &#8220;I want to give you a lady.&#8221;</p>



<p>Before deciding whether to accept or decline, I thought to myself: <em>Bro, who told you I’m heartbroken? Who told you I need a new talking stage?</em> But after some deliberation, I thought, <em>Why not?</em> I asked for the number. WAIT. I didn’t even consider the possibility that this friend of mine could be giving me the number of his ex or someone problematic. He claimed they were childhood friends, but from my observation, they resembled each other a bit—which made me wonder if they might be cousins.</p>



<p>Still, the thought—<em>what if she’s the one</em>—pushed me to accept. It’s the same thought that made me pursue the lady who ghosted me, even when all the red flags were screaming.</p>



<p>Let nature teach you.<br>You are not in it alone.<br>It will provide for your grievances.<br>They will be all gone.<br>Nature has answers to all our quests.<br>Yes, yes, it does.</p>



<p>Nature teaches us to be better in relationships, engineering, and even in innovations yet to come.</p>



<p>This petite-looking lady, Tinah, had an admirable figure, and I trusted she might be the one. It was an interesting affair. I even asked her if she thought I was the one, and she confidently said yes. At first, Tinah seemed genuinely interested in me. But as the holy book says, <em>time and chance happen to them all.</em></p>



<p>In this new talking stage, I carried unhealed trauma. Several times, I tried to bring up the matter of my previous ghosting experience, but it all went in vain.</p>



<p>Better now or never.<br>Say whatever makes you uncomfortable.<br>Just as the saying goes,<br>The early bird catches the worm.<br>In all aspects of life,<br>Communication is always key.</p>



<p>I felt guilty for not telling her, but at the same time, I wondered if her interest in me was waning because she saw my picture. Maybe she wasn’t interested in dating a techie guy who looked the way I do. We never met in person to explore if we were compatible beyond the surface.</p>



<p>This is one of the reasons I hate online dating. I mean, like, you don’t know someone in person, yet you want to date them? Wait, are you normal? Online dating feels like ordering a package of goods without knowing how it tastes, its size, or its weight.</p>



<p>There are things worth studying carefully. Men should approach someone they’re interested in, and ladies should give clear signals to help guys pursue them. I consider someone involved in online dating to be weak in one way or another. Kwani, watu uko karibu na wao hakuna mtu? If not, explore other options. Online dating is full of scams and shenanigans.</p>



<p>Your assumptions and imaginations<br>Shape who you are.<br>Yes, they do.<br>They define you and even your future.</p>



<p>One evening, while busy preparing my supper, Mary—the lady who ghosted me—called out of the blue. My first thought was: <em>Yooh! Who told you I’m traumatized for you to call me and calm my spirits?</em></p>



<p>She’d ghosted me, and now today she decides to check in? That call brightened my evening, and consequential actions followed. We planned to meet and resolve everything amicably, to plan a way forward for the two of us. But, as fate would have it, we never met to resolve anything. It all seemed to die again.</p>



<p>Time and chance will one day happen to them all, I gaze.</p>



<p>Hearts may be broken.<br>You may be traumatized.<br>You may be left alone in the ditch.<br>You may see only dust.<br>But remember,<br>You always have yourself to dust off<br>And move on.<br>Trust your instincts.<br>Never forget,<br>Your assumptions and imaginations<br>Are there to shape your life.</p>

They studied together, shared meals, and often delved into their shared passion for engineering and technology.

<p>In one of the bustling industrialized cities, there lived two engineering students named Teddy and Tensely. As classmates and close friends, the duo was inseparable. They studied together, shared meals, and often delved into their shared passion for engineering and technology. Among their many pursuits, information technology, coding, and even hacking intrigued them the most.</p>



<p>Tensely, in particular, was deeply obsessed with learning the art of hacking. While others focused solely on assignments and exams, Tensely immersed himself in understanding the vulnerabilities of systems. Teddy, on the other hand, was more pragmatic, a survival tactician who understood the city’s underbelly. Teddy&#8217;s street-smart ways complemented Tensely’s technical prowess, creating a dynamic partnership.</p>



<p>The two friends had an unbreakable bond, often likened to covalent bonds in chemistry—strong and enduring. They supported each other through thick and thin, including navigating tricky exams and dodging the watchful eyes of professors. Their teamwork was impeccable, each step meticulously planned and executed.</p>



<p>One evening, as the two were basking in the glow of the setting sun, Teddy turned to Tensely with a question that would change everything:<br>“Do you trust me?”<br>Tensely, with a thunderous certainty, responded, “Of course, I do.”</p>



<p>Teddy then shared an audacious idea—hacking an ATM to withdraw money undetected. At first, the plan seemed too bold, even for Tensely. But soon, his curiosity and hunger for adventure took over. The notion of pulling off such a heist was too thrilling to resist.</p>



<p>However, this wasn’t a scheme to be rushed. Teddy insisted on careful planning, knowing full well the consequences of being caught. The duo needed a stolen credit card to avoid leaving any traceable links to themselves. While Teddy worked on refining their strategy, Tensely took on the task of acquiring the crucial card.</p>



<p>One weekend, Tensely visited a neighbor’s house under the guise of casual conversation. While there, he stealthily swiped a credit card, fulfilling his part of the plan. Returning to campus, he eagerly presented the stolen card to Teddy, who praised his efforts but urged patience. They had pending coursework to complete before moving forward.</p>



<p>Three days later, the long-awaited moment arrived. The duo donned disguises to avoid being identified by CCTV cameras. Dressed in hoodies and masks, they scoped out the ATM and its surroundings, noting the positions of security guards. With all preparations in place, Tensely approached the machine, card in hand.</p>



<p>Teddy, stationed a safe distance away, monitored the situation. The plan was for Tensely to follow the sequence of commands Teddy had painstakingly programmed. If all went smoothly, the ATM would release the cash, and they would make a swift getaway.</p>



<p>As Tensely inserted the card and began the hack, adrenaline coursed through his veins. The machine whirred to life, and money started spewing out. Tensely quickly stuffed the bills into the bag he had brought. But just as things seemed to be going perfectly, disaster struck.</p>



<p>The ATM emitted a loud alarm, a security measure Teddy hadn’t anticipated. Tensely froze momentarily before grabbing the last of the cash and bolting out. Teddy, hearing the alarm, signaled Tensely to run. The two sprinted into the night, hearts pounding as the sound of approaching sirens grew louder.</p>



<p>Their carefully crafted plan was unraveling. The stolen card had triggered a bank alert, and security cameras had captured enough footage to raise suspicion. Though their disguises hid their identities, the authorities were now on high alert.</p>



<p>The two friends managed to escape the immediate vicinity, but the weight of their actions began to sink in. The thrill of the heist was replaced by the chilling realization that they were now fugitives. What started as a daring escapade had turned into a nightmare.</p>



<p>In the days that followed, tensions grew between Teddy and Tensely. Teddy blamed Tensely for acting impulsively, while Tensely accused Teddy of underestimating the risks. Their once-unbreakable bond was now strained under the pressure of their failed heist.</p>



<p>Eventually, the law caught up with them. A combination of forensic evidence and witness testimonies led to their arrest. Standing before the judge, they faced the grim reality of their choices. Their dreams of a bright future in engineering had been eclipsed by a reckless decision born out of arrogance and greed.</p>
