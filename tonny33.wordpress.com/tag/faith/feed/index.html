<p>Ooh, what a mystery, what a sight,<br>A whisper of wings in golden light.<br>From fragile eggs on tender leaves,<br>Life begins—soft as a dream it weaves.</p>



<p>Yes, a change, a wondrous thing,<br>A crawling form, yet set to wing.<br>The caterpillar, slow and small,<br>Yet holds within the promise of all.</p>



<p>Wrapped in stillness, tucked away,<br>A silent prayer, night meets day.<br>Cocooned in patience, time must flow,<br>Till life awakens, set to glow.</p>



<p>And then—ooh, behold the flight!<br>Colors bursting, pure delight.<br>The <strong>butterfly</strong>, a whispered grace,<br>A love of sky, a soft embrace.</p>



<p>What lessons in this dance so bright?<br>To change, to grow, to seek the light.<br>A symbol true, for man to see,<br>That life’s own hands bring destiny.</p>



<p>With wings of joy, the earth it sings,<br>The <strong>rain</strong> it calls, the <strong>pests</strong> it stills.<br>A balance held in fragile might,<br>A gift of love, a world in flight.</p>

<p><strong>Ooh! How nice is love between two new lover buds,<br>From the continuous butterflies to unending talks at night,<br>The talks that resolve no conflict, yet reflect the light<br>Of a love so pure, so new, it has only just begun—<br>Two hearts intertwined, beating as one.</strong> </p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Ooh my love, how and why did you dare?<br>To fall in love with me before consulting your Maker there.<br>Are you sure you shall unlove me from this very point?<br>When your heart already loved me, and mine loved you in joint?<br>Oh, I pity the thought of parting ways,<br>For you shall never forget these precious days.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>What love you entered with me, unmountable in might,<br>A love you risked for me, radiant and bright.<br>I promise, my dear, you won’t get over this,<br>The love I once gave is a gift, a bliss.<br>We’ve built our future; it’s already begun,<br>Together, forever, under the sun.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Just come back, and let our love reignite,<br>As it was before, in its glorious light.<br>For you shall suffer to find the love I gave—<br>A love so unyielding, so tender, so brave.<br>I tell you, my love, yes, baby, I mean it,<br>You won’t find this love anywhere, not even a bit.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Oh, the miscommunication, Ooh my lover, let’s resolve,<br>Before it bursts its streams and dissolves.<br>For our love is unmountable and unseparable,<br>Two individuals in love, strong and unbreakable.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ooh my love, why did you decide to ghost me,<br>And leave me adrift in this love’s vast sea?<br>I was there to listen, to love, to care,<br>Yet you vanished, leaving my heart bare.<br>I called, I texted, no reply came through,<br>I searched for your voice, your love, your hue.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Ooh my love, up to when shall I roam?<br>My love is dying, longing for its home.<br>It was not when I decided to search you out,<br>That I found you, by chance, without a doubt.<br>There you were, on the streets that day,<br>But my words had fled; I had nothing to say.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Frustration consumed me; I felt so lost,<br>I had given my all, regardless of cost.<br>Oh, my love, how I long for the moment to speak,<br>For the love I hold within makes me weak.<br>I tossed a promise, &#8220;We shall talk,&#8221; I said,<br>Yet the silence lingered, and hope seemed dead.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Still, my love, to this day, I stand,<br>With my heart in yours, my outstretched hand.<br>You shall remain, no matter what,<br>A love to my heart that cannot be forgot.<br>Ooh my love, I am here to stay,<br>To tell you, I am yours, forever and a day.</strong></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Let us reignite the fire, rebuild what was lost,<br>For true love’s worth is beyond any cost.<br>Together, let’s soar, like birds in the sky,<br>For our love is eternal—it shall never die.</strong></p>

<p></p>



<p>Have you ever wondered about the fate of your loved ones, friends, or even family members after they pass away? A fundamental question that arises is whether we are meant to meet the deceased when Jesus Christ returns to take His righteous ones back home. The Bible provides clear distinctions between two groups: the righteous and the unrighteous. Yes, He comes, and all the eyes in the world shall see Him. But is it really true that we will meet our loved ones at this time? Unfortunately, it will be too late to meet and converse with them, telling them how much we missed them and how glad we are to see them again.</p>



<p>The key difference lies in whether your loved one and you are among the righteous. If both of you are among the righteous, you will indeed meet and have the opportunity to spend eternity together. However, the opposite is true if your friend, loved one, or family member is among the unrighteous and you happen to be there as well. You will meet each other in the hell of a furious furnace.</p>



<p>The weight lies in the distinction between the righteous and the unrighteous. This means that if you are among the righteous and your friend or loved one is on the other end as an unrighteous individual, there will be no meeting. According to the Bible, this world we live in now is the very last meeting point for both of us, as we cannot judge each other to know whether our friend, loved one, or family member is either righteous or unrighteous.</p>



<p>In light of this, it is crucial to understand what the Bible says about the afterlife and our relationships with the deceased. The Bible clearly states in Hebrews 9:27, &#8220;Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment.&#8221; This emphasizes that after death, judgment follows, and this judgment determines whether one is among the righteous or the unrighteous.</p>



<p>In Matthew 25:31-46, Jesus speaks about the final judgment, where He will separate people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. The righteous, referred to as sheep, will be granted eternal life, while the unrighteous, referred to as goats, will be sent away into eternal punishment. This passage underscores the importance of living a righteous life and the eternal consequences of our choices.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, it is written, &#8220;For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.&#8221; This passage offers hope to believers, assuring them of a reunion with other believers and with the Lord.</p>



<p>Given these biblical insights, we can say without a doubt that the world we live in now is the last meeting point for both the righteous and the unrighteous. Since we cannot judge each other’s righteousness or lack thereof, it is imperative to live in peace with one another, cherishing the time we have together on earth.</p>



<p>Living a life that aligns with biblical principles is essential. In Romans 12:18, Paul advises, &#8220;If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.&#8221; This means we should strive to foster harmonious relationships, practicing love, forgiveness, and compassion.</p>



<p>Moreover, in John 15:12, Jesus commands, &#8220;My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.&#8221; This love is not merely an emotion but an action that reflects Christ&#8217;s sacrificial love. By loving others, we reflect God&#8217;s love and grace, fulfilling His commandments and preparing ourselves for the eternal life promised to the righteous.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the lies taught about meeting loved ones after Jesus Christ&#8217;s return need to be dispelled. The Bible provides clear guidance on the fate of the righteous and the unrighteous. While we have the opportunity to be with our loved ones now, the final judgment will determine our eternal destinies. Therefore, let us strive to live righteously, love one another, and seek peace, ensuring that we are among those who will be with the Lord forever.</p>
