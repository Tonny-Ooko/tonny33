<p>In a world full of friendships and dating scenes, relationships have become a complex market of choices and preferences. It&#8217;s always good and even perfect when your friend knows you&#8217;re &#8220;soko&#8221; — that you&#8217;re out there looking for someone. The soko is normally full of tomatoes, and it&#8217;s upon you to choose the tomato of your choice, perchance the one that best satisfies your needs.</p>



<p>But as it stands, there are so many intricacies when it comes to choosing. The ladies in the soko and the men in the same often have a well-structured list of their ideal partners. Ladies often prefer tall men with six packs, probably dark-skinned. On the other hand, many men love thick babes, brown-skinned ones, or even petite babes who drive them crazy. It&#8217;s a game, and as unfair as it might be, it&#8217;s often rigged against short or middle-sized men who tend to become the last resort. But that doesn’t mean all hope is lost.</p>



<p>Down trodden in the middle of ghosting.<br>From the babes I was taking stage with.<br>The earth sank low for me.<br>Never to get this place to rest on.<br>You can imagine with me,<br>Having someone you talk to every day.<br>And suddenly, she decides to ghost.<br>What a hell on earth.</p>



<p>You know instincts? I regretted not following mine with this specific lady. My instincts were utterly against her. But who was I? I decided to pursue her, against the warning bells ringing in my head, even though they were clear—this lady was bound to break my heart. One fine day, in the middle of my work coding, I got a WhatsApp text from my friend Gordon.</p>



<p>The text read: &#8220;I want to give you a lady.&#8221;</p>



<p>Before deciding whether to accept or decline, I thought to myself: <em>Bro, who told you I’m heartbroken? Who told you I need a new talking stage?</em> But after some deliberation, I thought, <em>Why not?</em> I asked for the number. WAIT. I didn’t even consider the possibility that this friend of mine could be giving me the number of his ex or someone problematic. He claimed they were childhood friends, but from my observation, they resembled each other a bit—which made me wonder if they might be cousins.</p>



<p>Still, the thought—<em>what if she’s the one</em>—pushed me to accept. It’s the same thought that made me pursue the lady who ghosted me, even when all the red flags were screaming.</p>



<p>Let nature teach you.<br>You are not in it alone.<br>It will provide for your grievances.<br>They will be all gone.<br>Nature has answers to all our quests.<br>Yes, yes, it does.</p>



<p>Nature teaches us to be better in relationships, engineering, and even in innovations yet to come.</p>



<p>This petite-looking lady, Tinah, had an admirable figure, and I trusted she might be the one. It was an interesting affair. I even asked her if she thought I was the one, and she confidently said yes. At first, Tinah seemed genuinely interested in me. But as the holy book says, <em>time and chance happen to them all.</em></p>



<p>In this new talking stage, I carried unhealed trauma. Several times, I tried to bring up the matter of my previous ghosting experience, but it all went in vain.</p>



<p>Better now or never.<br>Say whatever makes you uncomfortable.<br>Just as the saying goes,<br>The early bird catches the worm.<br>In all aspects of life,<br>Communication is always key.</p>



<p>I felt guilty for not telling her, but at the same time, I wondered if her interest in me was waning because she saw my picture. Maybe she wasn’t interested in dating a techie guy who looked the way I do. We never met in person to explore if we were compatible beyond the surface.</p>



<p>This is one of the reasons I hate online dating. I mean, like, you don’t know someone in person, yet you want to date them? Wait, are you normal? Online dating feels like ordering a package of goods without knowing how it tastes, its size, or its weight.</p>



<p>There are things worth studying carefully. Men should approach someone they’re interested in, and ladies should give clear signals to help guys pursue them. I consider someone involved in online dating to be weak in one way or another. Kwani, watu uko karibu na wao hakuna mtu? If not, explore other options. Online dating is full of scams and shenanigans.</p>



<p>Your assumptions and imaginations<br>Shape who you are.<br>Yes, they do.<br>They define you and even your future.</p>



<p>One evening, while busy preparing my supper, Mary—the lady who ghosted me—called out of the blue. My first thought was: <em>Yooh! Who told you I’m traumatized for you to call me and calm my spirits?</em></p>



<p>She’d ghosted me, and now today she decides to check in? That call brightened my evening, and consequential actions followed. We planned to meet and resolve everything amicably, to plan a way forward for the two of us. But, as fate would have it, we never met to resolve anything. It all seemed to die again.</p>



<p>Time and chance will one day happen to them all, I gaze.</p>



<p>Hearts may be broken.<br>You may be traumatized.<br>You may be left alone in the ditch.<br>You may see only dust.<br>But remember,<br>You always have yourself to dust off<br>And move on.<br>Trust your instincts.<br>Never forget,<br>Your assumptions and imaginations<br>Are there to shape your life.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Marriage and dating—timeless concepts that remain deeply intertwined with personal, societal, and cultural values—are as complicated as they are fascinating. In today’s fast-evolving world, these ideas continue to be challenged, redefined, and sometimes even rejected. This article seeks to explore the intricate layers of marriage and dating through the lens of unique personal experiences, cultural expectations, and modern approaches.</p>

<p>Dating and marriage have always been complex aspects of human relationships, influenced by culture, personal preferences, and societal norms. A fascinating example of this complexity is the story of a man who took a rather unconventional approach to express his interest in a woman. Instead of directly approaching Shiku, the lady he admired, he decided to talk to her mother first. This bold strategy, perhaps influenced by tradition or a desire to show respect, led to a sequence of events that tested his patience, resilience, and understanding of modern dating dynamics.</p>



<p>After making his intentions known to Shiku&#8217;s mother, he had to wait for two days to receive an answer. When he returned, he encountered Shiku, who bluntly rejected him. Insisting on hearing the verdict from her mother, he faced further complications. Her mother, seemingly overwhelmed by the numerous customers she dealt with daily, initially failed to recognize him. Matters escalated when a man in the house, assumed to be Shiku&#8217;s father, became confrontational upon learning of his intentions. The situation spiraled into a heated confrontation, with Shiku herself stepping in aggressively. Although the man escaped unharmed, the experience left him deeply traumatized, questioning the effectiveness of his approach.</p>



<p>Reflecting on this incident, one might consider the various factors at play. Was this a case of natural rejection, tribal bias, or miscommunication? His experience sheds light on the challenges of modern dating, where traditional and contemporary values often clash. While his approach was unconventional, it highlighted the evolving nature of relationships, where direct communication and mutual understanding are becoming increasingly crucial.</p>



<p>In today&#8217;s world, dating comes with its own set of expectations and complexities. Some advocate for the return of arranged marriages, arguing that they offered stability and alignment of values. However, this approach is not without its critics, particularly those who value personal choice and emotional connection. Another option is referrals, where trusted friends or family members introduce potential partners, offering a middle ground between arranged and self-initiated relationships. Ultimately, many prefer the freedom to choose their partners, although this freedom sometimes leads to repeated cycles of trial and error.</p>



<p>The role of men and women in relationships is also a topic of debate. While some argue for traditional roles, others emphasize equality and shared responsibility. The Bible, for instance, underscores the significance of men leading their families, though this interpretation varies among individuals. Modern relationships demand flexibility and mutual respect, with both parties contributing to their success.</p>



<p>For some, dating is likened to a supermarket experience—selecting and discarding partners at will. This perception, while criticized, reflects the transient nature of some modern relationships. Despite these challenges, the essence of dating and marriage remains rooted in effort, commitment, and shared values. As the Word affirms marriage as God-ordained, it emphasizes the importance of nurturing relationships with care and intention.</p>



<p>Ultimately, dating in the modern era requires adaptability and self-awareness. Whether through traditional methods, referrals, or contemporary approaches, individuals must navigate the complexities with patience and integrity. While the journey may not always be smooth, the lessons learned along the way contribute to personal growth and a deeper understanding of what it takes to build a meaningful relationship.</p>
