<p>It was a bright afternoon, and Tony sat in his home office, headphones on, eyes glued to the lines of code on his screen. He was engrossed in reviewing a website design, adjusting colors, tweaking fonts, and testing functionality. As a software engineer, Tony thrived in this world of logic and creativity. The concentration was intense, and the faint hum of his laptop accompanied the clicking of his keyboard.</p>



<p>Then, his phone buzzed. He glanced at it, frowning at the unknown number on the screen.</p>



<p>He debated whether to pick up. Unknown numbers often brought scam calls, awkward wrong numbers, or terse requests for surveys. Yet, curiosity got the better of him.</p>



<p>“Hello?” Tony said cautiously.</p>



<p>“Hi,” came the voice on the other end. It was a warm, friendly voice, though slightly uncertain. “Is this Tony?”</p>



<p>“Yes, this is Tony,” he replied. “Who’s calling?”</p>



<p>“My name’s Brightone,” the caller said. “I hope I’m not bothering you. I was trying to reach Tony—the one I spoke to earlier about a job opportunity.”</p>



<p>Tony raised an eyebrow. “I think you might have the wrong number. I’m not sure who you’re looking for, but I don’t recall any discussions about jobs.”</p>



<p>A pause followed, and Tony could almost feel the disappointment radiating through the phone.</p>



<p>“Oh,” Brightone said finally. “I must’ve dialed the wrong number. I was looking for the Tony who promised to help me find a job. I studied Biochemistry at the University of Nairobi and have been struggling to find something in the field.”</p>

<p>Tony’s interest was piqued. He leaned back in his chair, temporarily setting his work aside.</p>



<p>“Biochemistry,” he repeated, nodding to himself. “That’s a challenging but fascinating field. So you’ve been looking for work since you graduated?”</p>



<p>“Yes,” Brightone said, his tone softening as he spoke. “I’m really passionate about Biochemistry. It’s what I’ve always wanted to do, but opportunities are scarce, and I’ve been applying everywhere with no success.”</p>



<p>Tony listened, feeling a pang of empathy.</p>



<p>The world, so wide, so vast, so full,<br>Yet dreams are caught in life’s cruel pull.<br>A passion burning, bright, sincere,<br>Yet doors stay shut, hope turns to fear.</p>



<p>Life’s path, they say, is rarely straight,<br>Its twists and turns defined by fate.<br>And yet, we rise, we strive, we climb,<br>To catch the stars, to seize the time.</p>



<p>Tony broke the silence that followed the unspoken weight of Brightone’s words. “That must be really frustrating. Have you thought about exploring other fields while you wait for the right opportunity in Biochemistry?”</p>



<p>Brightone hesitated. “Well, yes, actually. I’ve always had some interest in ICT. I even started learning Python and R at one point. But…” His voice trailed off.</p>



<p>“But?” Tony prompted.</p>



<p>“I didn’t finish,” Brightone admitted with a self-deprecating laugh. “I started but never saw it through. Life got in the way, or maybe I just didn’t push myself enough.”</p>



<p>Tony smiled, though Brightone couldn’t see it. “That’s more common than you’d think. But you know, it’s never too late to pick it up again. Python is a great language, and if you’re looking for something manageable, you could try learning Flask. It’s a framework that’s easier to start with than Django, though it really depends on what you’re building.”</p>



<p>The best time to learn is yesterday,<br>They often say, but do not dismay.<br>For every moment, fresh and new,<br>Holds the power to see it through.</p>



<p>The hands of time may seem unkind,<br>But wisdom grows with every bind.<br>Begin today, with heart and mind,<br>And see what wonders you might find.</p>



<p>Brightone chuckled. “You sound like you’ve given this speech before.”</p>



<p>“Maybe,” Tony replied with a grin. “But seriously, you should give it another shot. Even if you go back to Biochemistry, having ICT skills could make you stand out. Employers love people who can bridge different fields. And Python? That’s useful almost anywhere.”</p>



<p>Brightone’s voice brightened. “You know, I think I will. Maybe it’s time to stop waiting for the right opportunity and start creating it.”</p>



<p>“That’s the spirit,” Tony said warmly. “Sometimes, the doors we’re waiting for don’t open because we’re meant to build our own.”</p>



<p>The world spins tales we cannot see,<br>A stranger’s voice, a destiny.<br>In moments chance, in calls unknown,<br>A seed of friendship may be sown.</p>



<p>For a moment, the two strangers were silent, connected by an unexpected sense of camaraderie.</p>



<p>Tony added, “You know, it’s funny how things happen. Sometimes, the wrong call can lead to the right connection. Life has a way of surprising us.”</p>



<p>The stars above may seem so far,<br>But guide us gently where we are.<br>Each stumble, twist, and winding bend,<br>Can lead us closer to a friend.</p>



<p>“You’re absolutely right,” Brightone said, his tone carrying newfound hope. “This call didn’t go as planned, but I think it was meant to happen. Thank you, Tony. You’ve given me a lot to think about.”</p>



<p>“Anytime, Brightone,” Tony replied. “And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions. We all need a little help sometimes.”</p>



<p>As the call ended, Tony returned to his work with a smile, the conversation lingering in his mind.</p>



<p>Sometimes, the world surprises us in the most unexpected ways. A wrong number, a stranger’s voice—these moments have the power to shape our days, to spark new ideas, to turn strangers into friends.</p>



<p>And as Brightone looked at his notebook that evening, ready to scribble down Python tutorials, he, too, smiled. Maybe, just maybe, the wrong call had been the right one all along.</p>

<p>In the land of endless clicks and crashes,<br>Where systems freeze in fleeting flashes,<br>I sat with hope, with faith in hand,<br>To conquer Windows, make a stand.</p>



<p>A screen of blue, a sudden black,<br>Each update came, and then came back.<br>The spinning wheel, a torturous sight,<br>I asked, &#8220;Why must this be my plight?&#8221;</p>



<p>I tried again, a virtual quest,<br>To install Windows in a peaceful nest.<br>A virtual machine, they said, could free,<br>But it failed me—oh, it failed me!</p>



<p>The bugs, the bugs! They never ceased,<br>Windows promised, yet found no peace.<br>A world of shenanigans, of endless woe,<br>Where every attempt seemed to steal the glow.</p>



<p>But then I thought of a distant shore,<br>A land where freedom reigns, once more.<br>Linux whispered in the winds so wide,<br>A place where hope and power collide.</p>



<p>A world of open doors, no chains,<br>No bloated apps or hidden pains.<br>&#8220;Come back,&#8221; it said, &#8220;let’s start anew,<br>No more frustrations, no more blue.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="168" data-attachment-id="184" data-permalink="https://tonny33.wordpress.com/2025/01/15/the-frustration-of-windows-the-call-of-linux/kali-2/" data-orig-file="https://tonny33.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/kali-1.jpeg" data-orig-size="300,168" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Kali" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://tonny33.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/kali-1.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://tonny33.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/kali-1.jpeg?w=300" src="https://tonny33.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/kali-1.jpeg?w=300" alt="" class="wp-image-184" style="width:620px;height:auto" srcset="https://tonny33.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/kali-1.jpeg 300w, https://tonny33.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/kali-1.jpeg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure>



<p>So, I packed my bags, my Windows dreams,<br>And thought of Linux as the silver streams.<br>A place to roam, a place to build,<br>To craft a world, to shape and wield.</p>



<p>But Linux, too, had its own test,<br>The installation, I thought, was best.<br>But there were issues, bugs again,<br>I tried to fix, I tried again.</p>



<p>The VM failed, just as before,<br>The struggles mounted, more and more.<br>I questioned myself, my heart so torn,<br>Had I made the right choice to be reborn?</p>



<p>Yet through the trials, I learned the cost,<br>That sometimes battles must be lost.<br>For each mistake was just a step,<br>A path I walked, a life adept.</p>



<p>No system perfect, no path complete,<br>The journey’s long, and quite the feat.<br>But in the end, the heart will know,<br>Where to call home, where to let go.</p>



<p>So now I stand, my mind made clear,<br>Windows has gone, no more the fear.<br>Linux, the land where freedom flies,<br>No more the chains, no more the lies.</p>



<p>And to all who struggle, who feel the burn,<br>Know that with each step, you&#8217;ll learn.<br>The systems break, the updates stall,<br>But in the end, you stand tall.</p>



<p>For not just machines, but hearts do grow,<br>And in the darkness, you will know,<br>That every failure is just a key,<br>Unlocking paths, setting you free.</p>



<p>Let others learn from this long tale,<br>The journey’s rough, but do not fail.<br>For Windows and Linux, both will call,<br>But you, my friend, must heed the thrall.</p>



<p>Choose what speaks to your inner voice,<br>And remember: your journey is your choice.</p>

<p>While the sun’s rays penetrate the darkroom,<br>Wine sits cooled in the Vessel of Grace.<br>The dark awaits on both sides of the table,<br>Ready to consume whoever enters.<br>That’s life to us, too.</p>



<p>While the darkness departs,<br>More chess to chess—<br>Even life’s game of chess,<br>We move in silence, thinking, deciding,<br>A strategy of hearts and minds,<br>As we navigate what lies ahead.</p>



<p>And on the chessboard, two remain standing,<br>While the rest are all laid down,<br>Each piece a memory, a choice, a chance.<br>In life, as in the game,<br>Not all moves are clear,<br>Not every path leads to victory,<br>But through every fall, there’s a rise.</p>

<p>The two that stand are a testament—<br>Strength and will, though the world may try<br>To pull them into darkness.<br>We stand, against the odds,<br>With grace in hand,<br>And our hearts steady,<br>For every move we make is a part<br>Of the story we live.</p>



<p>The Vessel of Grace, though small,<br>Offers solace, just as love does,<br>A constant in a world that shifts and sways,<br>Reminding us that no matter how many pieces fall,<br>There’s always room for one more move—<br>And with each move, we rise again.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Have you ever wondered about the fate of your loved ones, friends, or even family members after they pass away? A fundamental question that arises is whether we are meant to meet the deceased when Jesus Christ returns to take His righteous ones back home. The Bible provides clear distinctions between two groups: the righteous and the unrighteous. Yes, He comes, and all the eyes in the world shall see Him. But is it really true that we will meet our loved ones at this time? Unfortunately, it will be too late to meet and converse with them, telling them how much we missed them and how glad we are to see them again.</p>



<p>The key difference lies in whether your loved one and you are among the righteous. If both of you are among the righteous, you will indeed meet and have the opportunity to spend eternity together. However, the opposite is true if your friend, loved one, or family member is among the unrighteous and you happen to be there as well. You will meet each other in the hell of a furious furnace.</p>



<p>The weight lies in the distinction between the righteous and the unrighteous. This means that if you are among the righteous and your friend or loved one is on the other end as an unrighteous individual, there will be no meeting. According to the Bible, this world we live in now is the very last meeting point for both of us, as we cannot judge each other to know whether our friend, loved one, or family member is either righteous or unrighteous.</p>



<p>In light of this, it is crucial to understand what the Bible says about the afterlife and our relationships with the deceased. The Bible clearly states in Hebrews 9:27, &#8220;Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment.&#8221; This emphasizes that after death, judgment follows, and this judgment determines whether one is among the righteous or the unrighteous.</p>



<p>In Matthew 25:31-46, Jesus speaks about the final judgment, where He will separate people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. The righteous, referred to as sheep, will be granted eternal life, while the unrighteous, referred to as goats, will be sent away into eternal punishment. This passage underscores the importance of living a righteous life and the eternal consequences of our choices.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, it is written, &#8220;For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.&#8221; This passage offers hope to believers, assuring them of a reunion with other believers and with the Lord.</p>



<p>Given these biblical insights, we can say without a doubt that the world we live in now is the last meeting point for both the righteous and the unrighteous. Since we cannot judge each other’s righteousness or lack thereof, it is imperative to live in peace with one another, cherishing the time we have together on earth.</p>



<p>Living a life that aligns with biblical principles is essential. In Romans 12:18, Paul advises, &#8220;If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.&#8221; This means we should strive to foster harmonious relationships, practicing love, forgiveness, and compassion.</p>



<p>Moreover, in John 15:12, Jesus commands, &#8220;My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.&#8221; This love is not merely an emotion but an action that reflects Christ&#8217;s sacrificial love. By loving others, we reflect God&#8217;s love and grace, fulfilling His commandments and preparing ourselves for the eternal life promised to the righteous.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the lies taught about meeting loved ones after Jesus Christ&#8217;s return need to be dispelled. The Bible provides clear guidance on the fate of the righteous and the unrighteous. While we have the opportunity to be with our loved ones now, the final judgment will determine our eternal destinies. Therefore, let us strive to live righteously, love one another, and seek peace, ensuring that we are among those who will be with the Lord forever.</p>
